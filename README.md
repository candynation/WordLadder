Python Flask Web App for the popular game, Word Ladder

Word ladder is a word game where players are given two words and they have to find a sequence of words that can be formed by changing one letter at a time until the first word becomes the second word. The objective is to find the shortest possible word ladder between the two given words. The game can be played individually or in a group, and there are variations to increase the difficulty level.

For example, a word ladder between the words "COLD" and "WARM":
```
COLD -> COLE -> CARE -> WARE -> WARM
```
In this example, each step in the ladder involves changing one letter in the previous word to create a new word that is still a valid word in the English language. The objective of the game is to find the shortest possible word ladder between the two given words.
